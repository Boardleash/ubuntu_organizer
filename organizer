# A script to help organize files in a user's Desktop, Documents or Downloads directory.
# This will provide the user with an options of what directory they would like to organize.
# This has been tested on Ubuntu LTS 24.04 Desktop VM image.
# Due to some repetitive tasks within this function, comments will be layed out per function.
# Functions that repeat similar tasks will not have repeat comments (defer to the function that is commented).

# Define the introductory function.
